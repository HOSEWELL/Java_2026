🚀 My Java Learning Journey: From Basics to Mastery
Welcome to my Java repository! I am Hosewell, and I am dedicated to learning Java "all the way"—from the very first Hello World to building complex, object-oriented systems.

📌 Project Overview
This repository serves as a live documentation of my progress. Each folder represents a milestone in my understanding of the Java ecosystem.

🏗️ Core Concepts Covered
1. Methods & Logic
Understanding the "Vending Machine" concept of inputs and outputs.

Mastering static vs. instance methods.

Building interactive tools like the Simple Calculator.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Encapsulation: Using private fields and public getters/setters with data validation.

Inheritance: Building hierarchies like the UniversityPerson system using extends and super().

Constructors: Mastering this keyword and constructor overloading.

3. Data Integrity & Validation
Step-by-step verification of user input using Scanner.

Ensuring data constraints (e.g., validating 6-character alphanumeric IDs or GPA ranges).

🛠️ Project Structure
bank/: BankAccount class with deposit/withdraw logic.

school/: Student class implementing strict encapsulation.

university/: Inheritance hierarchy (Students, Professors, Staff).

assignments/: Daily coding tasks and problem-solving.

🎯 Current Goal
"I am learning Java all the way. My goal is to master clean code, efficient algorithms, and robust software design."
